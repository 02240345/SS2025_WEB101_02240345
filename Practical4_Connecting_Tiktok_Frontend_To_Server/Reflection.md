- Added retry logic for network failures
- Created user-friendly error notifications

**Key insight**: Good error handling improves user experience significantly.

#### Challenge 3: Real-Time UI Updates
**Problem**: UI needed to update immediately when users performed actions like liking videos.

**How I fixed it**:
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Added proper state synchronization after API calls
- Created loading states for better user experience
- Handled edge cases when API calls fail

**Learning outcome**: Optimistic updates make applications feel more responsive.

#### Challenge 4: Token Expiration Handling
**Problem**: JWT tokens expire and needed automatic refresh or logout.

**Solution implemented**:
- Added token expiration checking in API interceptors
- Implemented automatic logout when tokens expire
- Created token refresh mechanism
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures

**Result**: Seamless authentication experience without unexpected logouts.

#### Challenge 5: Component Data Flow
**Problem**: Passing data between components became complex with real API integration.

**How I approached it**:
- Used service functions to centralize API calls
- Implemented proper prop drilling and context usage

## Final Thoughts

Integrating the TikTok frontend with the backend was the most comprehensive project I've worked on. It taught me that building real applications involves much more than just making API calls - it requires careful planning of data flow, error handling, and user experience.

The most valuable lesson was understanding how authentication works in modern web applications. Implementing JWT tokens, protected routes, and global state management gave me practical skills that apply to most web applications.

The experience of handling real-time updates, managing loading states, and creating smooth user interactions taught me the importance of thinking about the user experience at every step. I now understand why proper error handling and loading states are crucial for professional applications.

This project has prepared me well for working on production applications and understanding the complete development lifecycle from frontend to backend integration. The systematic approach I developed for testing integration points and handling edge cases will be valuable for all future projects.
