## Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied

#### 1. Next.js App Router
I learned how to use Next.js to make websites that load fast. This system:
- Makes new pages automatically when I create folders
- Keeps some parts on the server and some in the browser
- Makes the website faster without extra work

#### 2. Building with Small Pieces
I made the website using small parts that I could use again:
- **MainLayout**: The main frame that goes around every page
- **VideoCard**: Shows one video at a time
- **VideoFeed**: Shows many videos together
- Each piece does one job and does it well

#### 3. Making Forms That Check Your Work
I used React Hook Form to make forms that tell you if you made mistakes:
- Checks your typing as you go
- Does not slow down the website
- Shows helpful error messages

#### 4. Making It Look Good on All Devices
I used Tailwind CSS to make the website work on phones and computers:
- Easy way to add styles
- Same spacing and fonts everywhere
- Changes size based on your screen

#### 5. Keeping Track of Information
I used React to remember things while you use the website:
- Remembers what you typed in forms
- Shows loading messages when processing
- Updates the page when things change

### What I Learned

#### Technical Skills
- **Next.js**: How to make websites with automatic page creation
- **Form Checking**: How to make sure people type the right things
- **Building Blocks**: How to make website pieces I can use many times
- **Phone-Friendly Design**: How to make websites work on any screen size

#### Good Habits
- **Organizing Files**: How to keep my code neat and easy to find
- **Reusing Code**: How to write code once and use it many places
- **User Experience**: How to make websites easy and nice to use

#### React Ideas
- **Passing Information**: How to send data between different parts
- **Handling Clicks**: How to make things happen when people click
- **Showing Different Things**: How to show different content based on what is happening

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

#### Problem 1: Making Forms Check for Mistakes
**What Went Wrong**: I did not know how to check if people typed emails correctly or if passwords were strong enough.

**Solution**: 
- I read the React Hook Form instructions carefully
- I learned how to use patterns to check emails
- I made custom rules to check if passwords matched
- I tested everything to make sure it worked

#### Problem 2: Making Menus Work on Phones
**What Went Wrong**: The side menu looked bad on phones and was hard to use.

**HSolution**:
- I made a side menu for computers
- I used Tailwind to hide and show things on different screens
- I made a simple top menu for phones
- I tested it on different phone sizes

#### Problem 3: Keeping Track of Information
**What Went Wrong**: I was not sure how to share information between different parts of the website.

**Solution**:
- I kept information close to where I needed it
- I used React's built-in ways to share information
- I made loading messages show up in the right places

#### Problem 4: Organizing My Files
**What Went Wrong**: I did not know the best way to organize all my files so I could find them later.

**Solution**:
- I put similar things in the same folders
- I used Next.js rules for organizing pages
- I separated reusable parts from page-specific code

### Key Takeaways

#### Best Practices Learned
1. **Small Parts**: Make each piece do one thing well
2. **Form Help**: Always tell users what is happening with their forms
3. **Clear Errors**: Show helpful messages when something goes wrong
4. **Clean Code**: Organize everything so I can understand it later

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Speed**: Make videos load faster
2. **Accessibility**: Make it easier for people with disabilities to use
3. **Testing**: Write tests to make sure everything works
4. **Managing Information**: Use better ways to share information in bigger projects

#### Future Learning Goals
1. Connecting to real databases
2. Making things update in real time
3. Advanced React tricks
4. Making websites even faster
5. Testing my code properly

### Conclusion

This project taught me a lot about making modern websites. I learned how to handle forms, make things look good on any device, and build websites with small reusable pieces. The problems I ran into helped me learn how to solve coding challenges and understand React better. Now I feel ready to build bigger and more complex websites.
